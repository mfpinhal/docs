# Currencies

In Uphold's API, we frequently call for a currency as an input or output. We represent all such currencies and stores of value by a three letter code as per `ISO 4217` codes.

In our Knowledge Base you will always find the most recent and up-to-date [list of the currencies we support](https://support.uphold.com/hc/en-us/articles/202473803), along with the three letter abbreviation you can use when referring to the currency within the API.
