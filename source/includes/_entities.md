The `user` object contains all information we have on record relating to the currently logged in user.
<aside class="notice">
  <strong>Privacy Notice</strong>: Users are only permitted to access information about themselves. Our API does not allow accessing information about other users.
</aside>

Property | Description
-------- | ----------------------------------------------------
memberAt | The date when the user has become a verified member.

### User Settings

- **otp.login.enabled** - This will prompt the user to input an OTP token when creating an OAuth token.
- **otp.transactions.send.enabled** - This will prompt the user to input an OTP token when creating a transaction to another user.
- **otp.transactions.transfer.enabled** - This will prompt the user to input an OTP token when transacting between the user's own cards.
- **otp.transactions.withdraw.crypto.enabled** - This will prompt the user to input an OTP token when withdrawing to the bitcoin network.

### User Status
We communicate a number of different user states through our API. At a high-level users can be in one of four states:

- **pending** - This state is present while the user is creating an account.
- **restricted** - When a user is in this state they are allowed to login to the application and receive money, but they are not permitted to initiate transactions. This state exists to allow users to satisfy additional data requirements.
- **blocked** - This state is present when a user has violated our terms of service. In this state users are unable to login or access the product.
- **ok** - Everything is ay-ok.

When users are in a specific state, the `verifications` field can help communicate the reasons for account status and potential suspension. These verifications have permissible values and in some cases, an associated reason. Here is an overview of the verifications field:

Flag      | Permissible Values               | Reason         | Description
